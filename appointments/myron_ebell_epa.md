Re:	Objection to Proposed Appointment of Myron Ebell as Chair of United States
Environmental Protection Agency

Dear Rep. **REP NAME**,

I am writing you as a concerned citizen and experienced environmental attorney with a strong commitment to issues affecting the environment that our children will inherit. I ask that you strongly and publicly condemn the decision by President-elect Trump to appoint Myron Ebell as chair of the EPA. Mr. Ebell has no formal scientific qualifications, is a climate change denial conspiracy theorist, and was previously employed by the hard-right anti-environmental protection Competitive Enterprise Institute. Mr. Ebell opposes the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change and has gone so far as to publicly pick fights with President Obama and the Pope on their common-sense support of measures to improve our environment.

I am also writing Senators **SENATOR1** and **SENATOR2** to express my concern and request that they formally vote against Mr. Ebellâ€™s confirmation as Chair of the EPA.

Yours Sincerely,

**SIGNATURE**
